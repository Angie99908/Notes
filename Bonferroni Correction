The Bonferroni Correction is used in statistics to:

Correct the problems caused by increasing the number of times a hypothesis is tested

The chance of the number of Type 1 errors occuring increases as the number of hypothesis tests increases.

If the alpha is set at .05, and four tests are run, the correction for each test is .0125.

The hypothesis can be tested at a/m, where a is the alpha level and m is the number of tests, 
or each hypothesis can be tests at any mount adding up the alpha total.

1 - a / m
